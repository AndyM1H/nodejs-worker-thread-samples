# Node.js Worker Thread Examples

This repository contains examples of using the `worker_threads` module in Node.js. It demonstrates how to utilize worker threads for parallel processing and handling CPU-intensive tasks efficiently.

## Features

- **Basic Examples:** Simple use cases to get started with worker threads.
- **Performance Tips:** Insights into improving application performance with concurrency.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the examples, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (version 14 or higher recommended): Node.js is required to execute the JavaScript code and manage dependencies.
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** (Node Package Manager): npm is used to install the project dependencies.

You can check your Node.js and npm versions by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
